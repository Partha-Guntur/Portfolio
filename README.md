- B.Tech., Computer Science and Engineering (Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) | Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (August 2021)

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ MKS Vision Pvt. Ltd (_Aug 2023 – Oct 2023_)**
- Had worked on Analyzing Credit & Loan Defaulters, in which we had access to real-time data from American Finance Company.
- built a pipeline for a little bit diverse and based on strong ML foundation, Overlook the Dataset from MS Excel, Apply Power query and filter the data, Data Cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Tuning, building a Classification and Regressive Models, apply Bagging and Boosting Techniques, model evaluation, then perform necessary visualizations.

**AI Research Intern @ Nova Automata Pvt. (_Nov 2024 – Present_)**
- Working on AI projects, where we are required to build RAG models, been improving to learn new content related to Large Language Models and Generative Adversarial Networks.
- I am trying to work on an important Text corpus dataset, constantly trying to improve the model's accuracy. We are currently building a demo LLM architecture, which is quite complicated and time consuming, but would achieve great results.
- It is quite interesting and also an important project which I'm currently working on.

## Projects
### Text Extraction using NLP
[Project Repo](https://github.com/Partha-Guntur/Text-Extraction-using-NLP.git)

Patient Detail Extraction Using NLP techniques and storing the information in Knowledge Graphs. Built a user-interface for the Examiner to store patient details, using Flask. It is built for extracting useful information to find the similar patients with same disease or problem can get particular diagnosis and dosage, which wouldn’t cost computational resources.
Patient Detail Extraction Using NLP and Storing it in the form of Knowledge Graphs Building an user-interface for the Examiner to examine the patient details and store it as Query.
